### 🎨 UI/UX Design Highlights

Each page in **Mind Mate** uses a **distinct color theme** aligned with its purpose, for example, calming dark green in meditation, warm green in mood tracking, and pure green and white shades in journaling to keep users engaged and emotionally connected.
Smooth **animations** enhance user interaction, making transitions feel natural and fluid.
The app also supports both **light and dark themes**, providing an optimal visual experience in any environment. This thoughtful design ensures that users feel a fresh, engaging vibe each time they open the app. and I didn't forget that red on emergency page is a symbolic shade of urgency.

All **without needing internet access**.
